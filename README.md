SC (Spatial Coalescent simulator) is a computer simulation tool for modeling spatial coalescent with recombination process. The algorithm implemented in SC is an improvement of the Wiuf and Hein algorithm (Wiuf and Hein, 1999). SC is proven to be the only precise ancestral recombination graph (ARG) simulator (Wiuf and Heinâ€™s has some redundant and MaCS misses some information) such as the distribution of ARG generated by SC is identical to that generated by a typical back-in-time model adopted by ms. SC is developed based on Macs-0.4e, all macs options are not changed. Thanks to Gary Chen to provide support.
